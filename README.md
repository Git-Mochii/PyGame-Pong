# PyGame-Pong

This is a game I made using the import "pygame", the game is called Ping-Pong.

The program fully derives itself from the original ping-pong classic game. You cannot resize the program as it is
prefixed at a specific resolution, additionally, at the time of writing there is no option to play against another
player; however this may be subject to change. 

How To Play
===========
- A user can run the Python code and a pop-up window will appear
- A user needs to click their left_mouse_button to initialize/start the game
- The game operates on the basic rules of ping-pong (ping the pong past the opponent's paddle to score)
- The player is pitted against an AI
- Uniquely, the speed of the pong increases as the game progresses
- To move the paddle, the player must use their up arrow key and down arrow key

[When the PLAYER or AI scores then the "CLICK TO PLAY" message will appear again]

[The AI (CPU) will typically lose around at speeds greater than 5]

[Score updates each time someone wins however, it does not save between different sessions/runs of the program]

Known Bugs
==========
I invite anyone to fix these issues and submit a request to create and upload a "bugless" program.

1. The collision between the pong and the paddle occasionally clips, however, this does not affect scoring as the pong will simply bounce off once inside of the paddle (I have no idea how)

Potential Future Features
=========================

1. Add a second user (player 2 ) and provide an option to play against the AI or a second player
